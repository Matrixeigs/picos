v0.1.0, 22.06.2012 -- Initial release. 

v0.1.1, 08.12.2012
     * Picos now interfaces GUROBI !
     * You can specify an initial solution to *warm-start* mixed integer optimizers.
     * Minor bugs with quadratic expressions corrected
     * It's possible to return a reference to a constraint added
       with add_constraint()

v0.1.2, 10.01.13
     bug-fix release, correcting:
     * The write_to_file() function for sparse SDPA files.
       The function was writing the
       coefficients of the lower triangular part
       of the constraint matrices
       instead of the upper triangle.
     * An IndexError occuring with the function
       remove_constraint()

v0.1.3, 17.04.13
     * geomean() function implemented, to handle inequalities involving
       geometric mean and reformulate them as a set of SOCP constraints.
     * Some options ['uboundlimit','lboundlimit'] were added to tell
       CPLEX to stop the computation as soon as a given value for the
       upper bound (or lower bound) is reached.
     * The time used by the solver is now stored in the dictionary
       returned bz solve().
     * It is possible to get the evolution of the lower and upper bounds
       over time, by using the option 'boundMonitor'.
     * The weak inequalities operator can now be used.
     * Minor bugs corrected (access to the duals of fixed variables with CPLEX,
       evaluation of constant affine expressions with a zero coefficient appearing
       in the dict of linear terms, number of constraints is now updated in remove_constraint() )
